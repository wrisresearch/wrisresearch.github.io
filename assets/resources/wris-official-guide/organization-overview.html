    <h2>Organization Overview</h2>

    <h3>History & Background</h3>
    <p>
        The Workgroup for Resilient Industrial Systems (WRIS) was founded by students of Athabasca University to address
        the absence of structured interdisciplinary academic and industrial collaboration. Recognizing the common
        challenges students face—such as limited access to real-world work experience and direction toward pressing
        industrial issues.

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
        WRIS operates through a structured framework designed to organize projects, responsibilities, and growth. The
        executive council posts projects on a workboard. Members can select
        projects aligned with their interests. Progress and contributions are tracked, and members
        advance through a tiered system by completing a set number and type of projects—such as research papers, video
        lectures, or reports. This structured approach ensures 
        transparent pathways for recognition and promotion within the organization.
