        established security protocols when handling sensitive data, accessing internal systems, and sharing materials.
        Passwords, access credentials, and confidential project information must be stored securely, with strict
        adherence to
        role-based access policies. Unauthorized sharing of data, whether internal or external, is prohibited. Members
