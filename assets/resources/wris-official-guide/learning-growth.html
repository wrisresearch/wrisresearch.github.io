    <h2>11. Learning & Growth</h2>

    <h3>Training Programs</h3>
    <p>
        Continuous learning is a cornerstone of WRIS membership. New and active members are encouraged to participate in
        structured
        training programs designed to develop both technical and professional skills. Recommended resources include
        curated online courses,
        SRS (Spaced Repetition System) flash cards for knowledge retention, and reference sheets covering core concepts
        and operational procedures.
        These materials help members build a strong foundation in resilient industrial systems, improve project
        execution, and prepare for advanced responsibilities.
        Members are expected to engage consistently with these programs, track their progress, and integrate learned
        techniques into their contributions.

    <h3>Mentorship & Peer Support</h3>
    <p>
        WRIS emphasizes collaborative growth through mentorship and peer support. Each new member is paired with an
        experienced counterpart
        to guide them through onboarding, project participation, and organizational practices. Mentors provide advice on
        workflow management, technical challenges,
        and professional development, while mentees contribute fresh perspectives and energy. Peer-to-peer support
        networks also foster knowledge sharing,
        problem-solving, and skill refinement, creating a culture of continuous improvement and mutual encouragement
        across all membership tiers.
    </p>

    <h3>Certifications & Skill Tracking</h3>
    <p>
        To recognize achievement and encourage measurable growth, WRIS implements a system for tracking member progress
        and certifications.
        Internal recognitions highlight milestones, successful project completions, and skill mastery, while external
        certifications are
        encouraged where applicable. Members maintain personal skill logs, document completed courses and training
        exercises, and submit
        evidence of accomplishments for review. This structured approach ensures transparency, motivates professional
        development, and aligns
        member growth with organizational goals, providing a clear path for advancement and expertise within WRIS.
