    <h2>5. Operating Principles</h2>

    <h3>Collaboration & Communication</h3>
    <p>
        Effective collaboration is central to WRIS’s mission. Members are expected to participate in scheduled meetings
        punctually, contribute actively, and maintain professional etiquette at all times. Communication should be
        clear,
        concise, and documented when necessary, ensuring that team members and leadership have a shared understanding of
        ongoing work. Decision-making follows a transparent process: proposals are discussed in relevant channels,
        reviewed
        by assigned leads, and finalized with documented outcomes. This approach ensures accountability, fosters
        constructive
        debate, and encourages input from all levels of the organization. Active listening and respectful dialogue are
        required in all interactions, promoting a collaborative culture where ideas are evaluated on merit rather than
        rank.

    <h3>Project Standards & Workflows</h3>
    <p>
        The executive council develops assignments based on necessity and industry trends. Members are
        fully responsible for initiative, creativity, and management within their chosen assignments. However, deliverables must meet
        all criteria specifically stipulated by the post on the workboard. Stipulations may include
        deadlines, dependencies, expected outputs, and more.
