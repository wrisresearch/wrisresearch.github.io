    <h3>Reference Sheets / Cheat Sheets</h3>
    <p>
        WRIS provides a comprehensive set of reference sheets and cheat sheets to streamline learning and operational
        efficiency.
        These resources summarize essential commands, workflows, and best practices across different domains, including
        research, project management,
        and technical tasks. By keeping these materials concise and accessible, members can quickly recall procedures,
        reduce errors, and maintain
        consistency in their contributions. New members are encouraged to review and familiarize themselves with these
        sheets regularly,

    <h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure clear communication and shared understanding, WRIS maintains a glossary of key terms, acronyms, and
        organization-specific language.
        This glossary covers technical terminology, project categories, and internal nomenclature used in meetings,
        documentation, and deliverables.
        Regular reference to this glossary helps new and existing members navigate the organization’s culture, align
        their work with expected standards,
        and foster accurate, efficient collaboration across interdisciplinary teams.

    <h3>Templates & Forms</h3>
    <p>
        Standardized templates and forms are provided to maintain consistency and quality in reporting, proposals, and
        project tracking.
        These documents include pre-defined formats for research reports, project summaries, time logs, and
        communication templates for internal or
        external use. Members are expected to use these templates to submit deliverables, document progress, and
        communicate findings.
        Adhering to standardized formats not only improves clarity and professional presentation but also simplifies
        review, feedback, and archival processes.
        Templates are regularly updated to reflect organizational best practices and evolving requirements.
