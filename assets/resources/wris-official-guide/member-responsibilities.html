    <h2>Member Responsibilities</h2>

    <h3>Core Expectations</h3>
    <p>
        Members of WRIS are expected to actively engage with the organization and its community. Collaboration extends beyond scheduled sessions, encompassing timely responses on
        internal
        communication platforms and proactive involvement in problem-solving activities. Knowledge sharing is a
        cornerstone
        of the group’s culture; members are encouraged to document insights, provide constructive feedback, and assist
        peers
        in understanding complex concepts or workflows. Accountability and reliability in these core activities ensure
        that
        both individual and collective efforts support the group’s mission of advancing resilient industrial systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Deliverables & Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        All members are responsible for producing exceptional deliverables. Deliverables may include audio/visual lectures, analytical reports, research findings, data visualizations,
        software tools, or other project-specific outputs. Each assignment may come with defined objectives, formats, and
        timelines, and members are expected to adhere to these standards. Peer review or supervisor evaluation ensures
        that work meets quality requirements and aligns with organizational goals. By consistently producing and
        refining outputs, members contribute to a transparent and productive environment where knowledge and results are readily
        accessible for future initiatives.
    </p>

    <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
    <p>
        Professional development is integral to a WRIS membership. Members are encouraged to develop skills that enhance both individual expertise and organizational
        capability. Learning activities may include workshops, online courses, collaborative research, or mentorship
        opportunities. Continuous learning not only ensures that members remain up-to-date with emerging methodologies
        and technologies but also strengthens the organization’s collective knowledge base. A culture of growth and
        curiosity empowers members to take on increasingly complex projects and positions them for higher levels of contribution
        and leadership within WRIS.
