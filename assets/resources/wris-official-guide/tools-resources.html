    <h2>Tools & Resources</h2>

    <h3>Internal Platforms</h3>
    <p>
        WRIS provides a set of internal platforms to facilitate collaboration, communication, and project management.
    </p>

    <h3>External Resources</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to internal tools, WRIS encourages members to leverage external resources for research, learning,
        and professional development. Subscriptions to journals, academic publications, and industry databases provide
        up-to-date insights into resilient industrial systems. Online learning platforms, tutorials, and webinars are
        recommended to enhance technical skills, project management capabilities, and interdisciplinary knowledge.
        Members are expected to integrate insights from these resources into their contributions, supporting
        evidence-based
        decisions and innovative approaches to project work.
    </p>

    <h3>Access & Permissions</h3>
    <p>
        Proper access to all tools is essential for participation. Members should follow the established procedures to
        request access to internal platforms.
        If permissions issues arise, members should consult the onboarding guide or contact the administrative team for
        troubleshooting support.
