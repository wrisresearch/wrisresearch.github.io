    <h2>Internal Processes</h2>

    <h3>Decision-Making Protocols</h3>
    <p>
        WRIS operates under a clear and structured decision-making framework to ensure that all organizational choices
        are fair, transparent, and aligned with the mission. Decisions are made using a combination of
        consensus-building
        discussions and formal voting when required. Leadership approvals are sought for strategic or high-impact
        initiatives,
        while day-to-day operational decisions may be delegated to team leads or committees. Members are encouraged to
        contribute their expertise during deliberations, ensuring that diverse perspectives are considered.
        Documentation
        of decisions and rationale is maintained for accountability and institutional memory.
    </p>

    <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        Conflicts, whether interpersonal or project-related, are addressed promptly and professionally. Members are
        expected
        to report issues through the designated channels to their team lead or executive council. A structured mediation
        process follows, beginning with informal resolution and escalating to formal review if necessary. All parties
        involved are given the opportunity to present their perspective, and impartial guidance is provided by the
        council
        or appointed mediators.
    </p>

    <h3>Performance Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
        WRIS evaluates member contributions, but there are no minimum performance requirements to maintain
        membership. The system is designed to be meritocratic, recognizing the significance of contributions without imposing compulsory
        participation.
