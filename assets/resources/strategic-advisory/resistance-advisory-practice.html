    <p>
        Resistance to change remains a reality in many organizations. Some individuals resist <strong>openly</strong>,
        while others may act <mark>subtly</mark> or indirectly to maintain existing practices. Advisors must recognize
        that resistance often stems from <strong>underlying concerns</strong>. <strong>Evidence</strong> can clarify why
        change is necessary
        and what <mark>benefits</mark> it may bring, but advisors must also acknowledge the <em>human dimensions</em> of
        resistance.
        Combining <strong>logical reasoning</strong> with <strong>empathy</strong> allows advisors to address both
        <strong>practical</strong>
        and <strong>emotional</strong> responses. Explaining the reasons for change and demonstrating the potential
        benefits
        helps individuals understand not just <mark>what is changing</mark> but <mark>why it matters</mark> (Smit).

        <strong>Feedback mechanisms</strong> allow auditors and advisors to adjust their guidance when resistance is
        observed.
        When change efforts include measurement of <mark>key indicators</mark>, advisors can monitor the effects of
        implementation
        and refine recommendations accordingly. Closing feedback loops creates a continuous process of
        <strong>learning</strong>
        and <strong>alignment</strong>, rather than a one‑time push for adoption. Addressing resistance through
        <strong>data</strong>
        and <strong>communication</strong> does not eliminate discomfort, but it gives stakeholders a clearer basis for
        making <mark>informed decisions</mark> (Smit).
