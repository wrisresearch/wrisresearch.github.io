        <strong>Data‑driven leadership</strong>, <strong>disruptive thinking</strong>, and <strong>influence</strong>

        For auditors, <strong>data</strong> provides a foundation for <strong>verification</strong> and
        <strong>assurance</strong>.
        For advisors, <strong>data</strong> supports recommendations that are <mark>defensible</mark> and relevant.
        <strong>Disruptive thinking</strong> enables professionals to see beyond established patterns and to propose
        more effective ways of working. <strong>Influence</strong> ensures that recommendations reach beyond technical
        reports
        to engage others in <strong>action</strong>. Together, these practices help organizations align operations with
        <mark>strategic goals</mark>, improve <strong>risk management</strong>, and drive <strong>sustainable
            change</strong>.
