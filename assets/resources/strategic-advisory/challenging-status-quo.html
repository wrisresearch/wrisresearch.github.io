    <p>
        Auditors and advisors are uniquely positioned to question established <mark>routines</mark> and
        <mark>practices</mark>.
        Organizations often operate with <strong>norms</strong> that were never explicitly evaluated for effectiveness.
        Without critical scrutiny, these norms become invisible barriers to <strong>improvement</strong>.
        Challenging the status quo means identifying ways of working that do not add value and recommending
        <strong>evidence‑backed changes</strong>. <strong>Disruptive leadership</strong>, as a concept, involves
        fundamental shifts in practice rather than small, incremental adjustments. It requires professionals to remove
        old practices and to replace them with approaches that are informed by <strong>robust data</strong> and
        <strong>insights</strong> (Pete).

        <strong>Disruptive leaders</strong> do not simply generate ideas in isolation; they continually learn and adapt.
        <strong>Lifelong learning</strong> is part of challenging assumptions because it encourages individuals to seek
        out new information that informs better decision‑making. Advisory work often requires this same openness to
        learning, especially as <mark>complex systems</mark> and expectations evolve. Advisors who remain curious, who
        examine assumptions, and who are willing to suggest changes based on <strong>evidence</strong> help
        organizations
        avoid stagnation. Without this willingness to disrupt inefficient patterns, organizations risk slipping into
        wasted effort, lost opportunities, and diminished <strong>competitiveness</strong> (Pete).
